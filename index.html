        <h3>Why 3D Printing?</h3>
        <p class="w3-large">If you have never delt with or have had something 3D printed, most people will underestimate the power and enigneering of 3D printers. Just the concept of turning a spool of plastic into anything you can imagine. This technology is already being used in hospitals for emergency situations, and are even printing car and airplane parts. To introduce curious customers to this technology, every first order that you make, comes with a 10% discount, so that way your first print is even cheaper and you can get one print with ease. </p>
